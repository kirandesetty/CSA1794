CREATE TABLE department(
    ID int,
    NAME Varchar(20),
    Gender Varchar(5),
    DateOfBirth Date);
You can use the below statement to query the description of the created table:

EXEC sp_columns department;


Adding Data to Table:
The date data type uses the format ‘YYYY-MM-DD‘. Use the below statement to add data to the department table:



INSERT INTO department VALUES (1,'Neha','F','1994-06-03');
INSERT INTO department VALUES (2,'Harsh','M','1996-03-12');
INSERT INTO department VALUES (3,'Harsh','M','1995-05-01');
INSERT INTO department VALUES (4,'Rupali','F',1996-11-11');
INSERT INTO department VALUES (5,'Rohan','M','1992-03-08');
To verify the contents of the table use the below statement:

SELECT * FROM department


Here, we will assume the DOB range to be from 1995-01-01 to 1996-12-31.

Query:
Now we will use the below syntax to query for the name of the Distinct Employee whose DOB is between a given range:

Syntax:
SELECT DISTINCT column_name1 FROM table_name 
WHERE column_name2 between value1 and value2;
So the query for our table goes as shown below:

SELECT DISTINCT NAME FROM department 
WHERE DateOfBirth between '1995-01-01' and '1996-12-31';
